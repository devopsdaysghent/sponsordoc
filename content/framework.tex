\section{About DevOpsDay}

\frame{
	\frametitle{History}
		DevOpsDays is a worldwide community of nonprofit conferences about software development, IT production activities and how to bring them together.
		Each event is organised by a team of local volunteers. The first DevOpsDays conference has been held in \textbf{Ghent}, Belgium in 2009.
		Since then, events have multiplied in cities around the world to reach over 70 events.
}

\frame{
	\frametitle{Sponsoring}
		DevOpsDays is a self-organizing conference for practitioners that depends on sponsorships.
		We do not have vendor booths, sell product presentations, or distribute attendee contact lists.
		Sponsors have the opportunity to have short elevator pitches during the program and will get recognition on the website and social media before, during and after the event.
		Sponsors are encouraged to represent themselves by actively participating and engaging with the attendees as peers.
		Any attendee also has the opportunity to demo products/projects as part of an open space session.
		The best thing to do is send engineers to interact with the experts at DevOpsDays on their own terms.
